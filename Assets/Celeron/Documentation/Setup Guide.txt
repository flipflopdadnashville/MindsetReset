SETUP GUIDE
1. From this asset’s profile page, click on the buy button right underneath the title.
2. You’ll be forced to open the Unity engine. Once you’re in Unity and you see my asset’s profile page, click on the download button from the Asset Store tab.
3. A window named ‘Importing package’ will show up that lets you choose which asset folders you want to add to your game. Select all the folders, then click 'Import.'
4. After it’s done importing, you should see a folder on your Project tab called ‘Celeron.’ Open that, then open the ‘Prefabs’ folder.
5. Drag and drop the 'Celeron' prefab from the Project tab to the Heiarchy tab. Make sure that no objects are parented underneath or on top of the prefab object.
6. Once you see the Celeron tool on your selected prefab object’s properties, you’re all set! This package also has a Unity driving scene that you can utilize for other potential applications in case you need it.
